# Sales Summary Single-Page Application

This minimal client-side web application fetches sales data embedded directly within the script, computes the total sales from the CSV data, updates the UI dynamically, and performs specified validation checks.

## Summary
- Loads Bootstrap 5.3.3 stylesheet from CDN with fallback styles.
- Sets the page title to include a seed.
- Reads CSV data embedded as a string.
- Parses the CSV to sum the 'sales' column.
- Displays the total sales with two decimal places.
- Performs runtime validation for correct title, presence of Bootstrap, and accurate calculation within a threshold.

## Setup
- Save the provided `index.html` content into an HTML file.
- No additional setup or dependencies are needed â€” all logic is client-side and embedded.

## Usage
- Open `index.html` in a web browser.
- The total sales are displayed automatically based on the CSV data.
- Validation logs appear in the browser console.

## Code Explanation
- The `<link>` tag loads Bootstrap CSS with an `onerror` fallback.
- Inline CSS provides basic styling if Bootstrap fails.
- The CSV data is embedded as a string in JavaScript.
- The script sets the page title, parses CSV data, computes sum, and updates the DOM.
- Validation checks confirm the page title, presence of Bootstrap stylesheet, and the accuracy of calculations.
